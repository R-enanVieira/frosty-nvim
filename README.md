## What is it?

Frosty is a modern and fully configured development environment for neovim with a focus on functionality and looks.

Check the [roadmap](https://github.com/SystematicError/frosty-vim/issues/1) for upcoming changes.

## Installation

### Nix

Make sure that the `flake` and `nix-command` [experimental features](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/unstable/contributing/experimental-features.html) have been enabled.

To try frosty without installing:

```
nix run github:systematicerror/frosty-vim
```

### Non-nix

Unlike other flake based neovim configurations, frosty is backwards compatible with typical non-nix neovim configurations, although currently `init.lua` requires some slight tweaking to correct load the plugin manager.
